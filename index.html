        <p>ragdoll cat main contents.Ragdolls are large, laid-back, semi longhaired cats with captivating blue eyes. 
        The Ragdoll is a pointed breed, which means that the body is lighter in color than the points 
        (the face, legs, tail and ears). The Ragdoll cat is carefully bred to produce large affectionate animals 
        in three patterns, two with white (mitted and bi-color) and one with no white (colorpoint). 
        The ideal Ragdoll is a well balanced cat, with no extreme features. Altered males will usually top the scale 
        at 15-20 pounds; females are proportionately smaller and usually weigh between 10-15 pounds at maturity. 
        Ragdolls are slow-maturing, reaching full coat color at two years, and full size and weight at four.
        Despite the colorful and completely impossible legend of the origin of the Ragdoll, this beautiful cat is one of the most popular breeds in the cat fancy. What can be verified is that the breed was started in the 1960s in California. The Ragdoll may well have been a mix of the Burmese, Birman, and the Persian, but the cat credited as the original Ragdoll is a white cat named Josephine. For that reason, Ragdolls are also called the daughters of Josephine.

        <p>The creator of the Ragdoll, Ann Baker, felt that she had in Josephine a cat that was so placid that she went limp when held. This characteristic is the origin of the name. This name was copyrighted by Ann Baker and can only be used for this breed of cat.
        
        The Ragdoll has extremely strict standards for color placement and the breed 
        is not allowed any outcross in breeding. However, new colors are being introduced in this breed, 
        so the Ragdolls seen now are even more colorful than in the past.</p>

    <p>Personality:The Ragdoll is a placid cat but does not really go limp when you hold her. 
        She is even tempered and gets along well with all family members. Changes in routine generally do 
        not upset her. She is an ideal companion for those in apartments.
        Living With:
        The Ragdoll tends to have a fatty pad on the lower abdomen. While this pad is acceptable in the breed, it is not an excuse for letting her get overweight or out of condition. The nutrition of the ragdoll should be carefully controlled.
         The Ragdoll needs interactive exercise in addition to playing room in order to keep her in shape. If need be, her parent should spend a dedicated period of time each day playing with her.
        While impressive, the coat is easier to care for than it first appears. The coat should be brushed daily, but this should be all that is needed in order to keep knots and tangles out of the coat.
